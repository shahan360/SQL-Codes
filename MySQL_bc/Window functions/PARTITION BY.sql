-- PARTITION BY clause in a window function allows you to divide the result set into partitions to perform calculations within each partition.

-- In this example, we will create a table named `employees` and demonstrate the use of the PARTITION BY clause with various window functions.
SELECT 
    emp_no, 
    department, 
    salary, 
    AVG(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department) AS dept_avg,
    AVG(salary) OVER() AS company_avg
FROM employees;
 
SELECT 
    emp_no, 
    department, 
    salary, 
    COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY department) as dept_count
FROM employees;
 
SELECT 
    emp_no, 
    department, 
    salary, 
    SUM(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department) AS dept_payroll,
    SUM(salary) OVER() AS total_payroll
FROM employees;
