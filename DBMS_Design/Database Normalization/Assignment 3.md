Use the following table for all questions.



1. Describe a situation that could lead to an update anomaly.

Some of the update anomalies I identified are:

Updating the advisor - Mr. Jones is in two rows.

Updating the Classes - For example, Physics and Art are listed several times.

2. How could an insert anomaly occur with this table?

An advisor is hired, but hasn't been assigned any students.

3. When could a deletion anomaly affect the table?

If Ms. Jackson retired, and we remove her from the table, the Jack Knowles is removed as well.

4. The above table isnâ€™t normalized.  Describe changes would you make to the table to adopt it to 1st normal form.

The changes I would make are:

Remove the repeated Class columns from the table.

Student column is a composite value and should be broken into First and Last names.

There is no primary key, I would establish StudentID as a primary key.
