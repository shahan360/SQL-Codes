--UNION Operator is used to combine the result-set
--of two or more SELECT statements.

--It basically serves to directly concatenate two
--results together, essentially "pasting" them 
--together on top of each other.

--It should be logical, it should be placed mannerfully 
--on top of each other.
--Ex:
--Select * from sales2021_Q1
--UNION
--Select * from sales2021_Q2
--Order By name;
