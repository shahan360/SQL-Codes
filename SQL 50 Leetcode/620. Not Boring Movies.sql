Table: Cinema

+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
 

Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".

Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Cinema table:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |

| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Output: 
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Explanation: 
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.

-- This SQL query selects all columns from the Cinema table where the id is odd,
-- the description does not contain the word 'boring' in any case, and orders the result by rating in descending order.

SELECT 
    * -- Select all columns
FROM 
    Cinema -- From the Cinema table
WHERE 
    id % 2 != 0 -- Filter rows where the id is odd (not divisible by 2)
    AND LOWER(description) NOT LIKE '%boring%' -- Filter rows where the description does not contain the word 'boring' in any case
ORDER BY 
    rating DESC; -- Order the result by rating in descending order
