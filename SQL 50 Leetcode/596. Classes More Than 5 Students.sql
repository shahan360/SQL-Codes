The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Courses table:
+---------+----------+
| student | class    |
+---------+----------+
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |

| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |
+---------+----------+
Output: 
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
Explanation: 
- Math has 6 students, so we include it.
- English has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Biology has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Computer has 1 student, so we do not include it.
