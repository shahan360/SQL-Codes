P(R) represents a pattern drawn by Julia in R rows. The following pattern represents P(5):

-- Create a temporary table of numbers (We are creating common table expression for creating a table that contains numbers from 1 to 20)

-- Dry Run:
To understand how the given code snippet works, let's perform a dry run of the recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) in MySQL. This CTE generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 20.

Here is the code snippet:

WITH RECURSIVE Numbers AS (
    SELECT 1 AS n
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1 FROM Numbers WHERE n < 20
)
Dry Run Explanation
Initial Step:

The CTE starts with the anchor member, which is SELECT 1 AS n. This part of the query runs first and initializes the sequence with the value 1.
sql
Copy code
Initial set: {1}
Recursive Step:

The recursive member SELECT n + 1 FROM Numbers WHERE n < 20 runs next. It takes each value from the current set and adds 1 to it, provided the resulting value is less than or equal to 20.
This step repeats, generating the next number in the sequence each time, until the condition n < 20 is no longer satisfied.
Iteration Breakdown
Iteration 1:

Anchor member produces: {1}
Current set: {1}
Iteration 2:

Recursive member takes 1 and produces 1 + 1 = 2
Current set: {1, 2}
Iteration 3:

Recursive member takes 2 and produces 2 + 1 = 3
Current set: {1, 2, 3}
Iteration 4:

Recursive member takes 3 and produces 3 + 1 = 4
Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Subsequent Iterations continue similarly, adding the next number each time:

Iteration 5:  Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Iteration 6:  Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Iteration 7:  Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Iteration 8:  Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Iteration 9:  Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Iteration 10: Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Iteration 11: Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}
Iteration 12: Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}
Iteration 13: Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
Iteration 14: Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Iteration 15: Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
Iteration 16: Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}
Iteration 17: Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}
Iteration 18: Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}
Iteration 19: Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Iteration 20: Current set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}
Termination:
The recursion stops when n reaches 20, as the condition n < 20 fails for n = 20.
Final Result
The CTE Numbers now contains the sequence from 1 to 20:

-- Select the pattern based on the numbers table
SELECT REPEAT('* ', 21 - n) AS pattern_line
FROM Numbers
ORDER BY n;
Explanation
*REPEAT(' ', 21 - n)**: This function repeats the string '* ' a specific number of times. The number of repetitions is determined by the expression 21 - n, where n is a value from the Numbers table.

FROM Numbers: This indicates that the REPEAT function will be applied to each row in the Numbers table, which contains numbers from 1 to 20.

ORDER BY n: This ensures the output is ordered by the value of n, which means the pattern lines will be generated from the largest number of repetitions to the smallest.

Iteration Breakdown
Let's see the result of the query for each value of n in the Numbers table:

For n = 1:
21 - 1 = 20
REPEAT('* ', 20) produces: '* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * '
For n = 2:
21 - 2 = 19
REPEAT('* ', 19) produces: '* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * '
For n = 3:
21 - 3 = 18
REPEAT('* ', 18) produces: '* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * '
For n = 4:
21 - 4 = 17
REPEAT('* ', 17) produces: '* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * '
For n = 5:
21 - 5 = 16
REPEAT('* ', 16) produces: '* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * '
For n = 6:
21 - 6 = 15
REPEAT('* ', 15) produces: '* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * '
For n = 7:
21 - 7 = 14
REPEAT('* ', 14) produces: '* * * * * * * * * * * * * * '
For n = 8:
21 - 8 = 13
REPEAT('* ', 13) produces: '* * * * * * * * * * * * * '
For n = 9:
21 - 9 = 12
REPEAT('* ', 12) produces: '* * * * * * * * * * * * '
For n = 10:
21 - 10 = 11
REPEAT('* ', 11) produces: '* * * * * * * * * * * '
For n = 11:
21 - 11 = 10
REPEAT('* ', 10) produces: '* * * * * * * * * * '
For n = 12:
21 - 12 = 9
REPEAT('* ', 9) produces: '* * * * * * * * * '
For n = 13:
21 - 13 = 8
REPEAT('* ', 8) produces: '* * * * * * * * '
For n = 14:
21 - 14 = 7
REPEAT('* ', 7) produces: '* * * * * * * '
For n = 15:
21 - 15 = 6
REPEAT('* ', 6) produces: '* * * * * * '
For n = 16:
21 - 16 = 5
REPEAT('* ', 5) produces: '* * * * * '
For n = 17:
21 - 17 = 4
REPEAT('* ', 4) produces: '* * * * '
For n = 18:
21 - 18 = 3
REPEAT('* ', 3) produces: '* * * '
For n = 19:
21 - 19 = 2
REPEAT('* ', 2) produces: '* * '
For n = 20:
21 - 20 = 1
REPEAT('* ', 1) produces: '* '
Final Output
The query generates the following result set:

This output corresponds to the desired pattern P(20), where each line contains a decreasing number of '* ' starting from 20 repetitions down to 1 repetition.
